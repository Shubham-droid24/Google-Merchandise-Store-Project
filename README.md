When it comes to making big (or small) business decisions, it’s important to ensure  your decision doesn’t hurt your existing customers, but rather enhances their user experience. It’s more rewarding if it can attract more new users. So, to make a safe and informed decision, you’ll need to know your visitors first.

Search engine optimization (SEO) is one of the most crucial aspects in determining your business growth. The more organic traffic your business site receives, the more leads and conversions it gains.

## What is Google Analytics?

Google Analytics is a web analytics service that provides statistics and basic analytical tools for search engine optimization (SEO) and marketing purposes. The service is part of the Google Marketing Platform and is available for free to anyone with a Google account.

Google Analytics is used to track website performance and collect visitor insights. It can help organisations determine top sources of user traffic, gauge the success of their marketing activities and campaigns, track goal completions (such as purchases, adding products to carts), discover patterns and trends in user engagement and obtain other visitor information such as demographics. Small and medium-sized retail websites often use Google Analytics to obtain and analyse various customer behaviour analytics, which can be used to improve marketing campaigns, drive website traffic and better retain visitors.

3) Sessions. The group of visitor interactions that happen in a 30-minute window of activity.
4) Average session duration. How long on average each visitor stays on the site.
5) Percentage of new sessions. The percentage of website visits that are first-time visits.
6) Pages per session. The average number of page views per each session.
7) Goal completions. The number of times visitors complete a specified, desirable action. This is also known as a conversion.
8) Page views. Total number of pages viewed.

## What is Cohort Analysis ?

Cohort Analysis is a type of Behavioral Analytics in which large volumes of complex Data is broken into related groups to perform Analysis. These smaller groups or Cohorts tend to share common characteristics or experiences within a specific time span. This process enables an organization to recognize important trends and patterns across the life cycle of a user/customer through a Cohort rather than accessing each individual customer.

Cohort Analysis is also used as a tool to measure user engagement over a period of time. Data from a given eCommerce platform, web application, or online game is used for Analysis and rather than looking at all users as a unit, it breaks them down into related groups.

Like customers who log on to the platform on a daily basis can be put into one Cohort, users which use the platform only once a month can be put into another Cohort, users subscribing for ad-free service can be put into one Cohort. These different Cohorts can help the organization target the requirements of these users better and strategize their services and products accordingly. The analysts of the social media platform would be catered with a visualization of these different groups, helping them to track the behavior of these users in a targeted manner.



## Some of the important insights that I had gained from the Cohort Analytics Dashboard:

1. Average conversion rate per user is highest for the day 2 of the month and the number is 3.55%.
2. Highest Conversion Rate per user is 7.11 % on 28th April.

## What is Funnel Analytics ?

A funnel analysis is a method of understanding the steps required to reach an outcome on a website and how many users get through each of those steps. The set of steps is referred to as a “funnel” because the typical shape visualizing the flow of users is similar to a funnel in your kitchen or garage.

For example, consider a fictional e-commerce company whose ultimate goal (often called a conversion or macro conversion) is to get users who visit the site to make a purchase. The steps required to make a purchase on our site are: visiting the site, adding a product to the shopping cart, clicking to check out and completing the purchase. These steps are sometimes also called goals or micro conversions.
