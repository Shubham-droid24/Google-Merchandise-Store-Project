I have created interactive dashboards on Google Merchandise Store website using Google Analytics on Looker Studio . It is an E-Commerce site that sells Google-branded
merchandise. I have made 3 dashboards: Google, Cohort and Funnel Analytics.

## Why website analytics is important ?

1. Get to Know Your Visitors Well and Enhance User Experience
   
When it comes to making big (or small) business decisions, it’s important to ensure  your decision doesn’t hurt your existing customers, but rather enhances their user experience. It’s more rewarding if it can attract more new users. So, to make a safe and informed decision, you’ll need to know your visitors first.

2. Know Your Best Content and Focus on it
   
Website analytics tools like Google Analytics and MonsterInsights show you exactly which content gets the most visits, average duration, and bounce rate for the individual pages, so you can analyze, and optimize, for better engagement.

3. It Helps Your Site’s SEO
   
Search engine optimization (SEO) is one of the most crucial aspects in determining your business growth. The more organic traffic your business site receives, the more leads and conversions it gains.

Website analytics help your site’s SEO in various ways. By knowing your visitors’ demographics and interests, you can create targeted content and get better visibility on search engines. Furthermore, you can gain some insights on backlinks by tracking your referrals.

4. Track Top Referrals and Build Strategies to Gain More of Them
   
Using website analytics, you can track who referred most traffic to your business site, analyze, and focus on strategies to gain more referrals from them.

For example, if your site receives most traffic from search engines, it means your site SEO is strong. Now with little extra effort, you can improve your website’s online visibility and gain more traffic than ever before.

5. Easily Track Your eCommerce Metrics and Utilize Them for More Sales
   
Whether you are selling physical products, software, or online services, the sales report is the most important report you should get to know. Thankfully, website analytics tools like Google Analytics and MonsterInsights show you all your important eCommerce metrics like total revenue, conversion rates, top products, top referral sources, etc. in a single report.

## What is Google Analytics?

Google Analytics is a web analytics service that provides statistics and basic analytical tools for search engine optimization (SEO) and marketing purposes. The service is part of the Google Marketing Platform and is available for free to anyone with a Google account.

Google Analytics is used to track website performance and collect visitor insights. It can help organisations determine top sources of user traffic, gauge the success of their marketing activities and campaigns, track goal completions (such as purchases, adding products to carts), discover patterns and trends in user engagement and obtain other visitor information such as demographics. Small and medium-sized retail websites often use Google Analytics to obtain and analyse various customer behaviour analytics, which can be used to improve marketing campaigns, drive website traffic and better retain visitors.

## What is Looker Studio ?

Looker Studio,formerly Google Data Studio, is an online tool for converting data into customizable informative reports and dashboards introduced by Google on March 15, 2016. Looker Studio provides powerful data visualization tools that make it easy to create beautiful interactive charts, diagrams, and tables from any data by simply dragging objects onto the canvas.

## Important metrics

Google Analytics enables users to track up to 200 different metrics to measure how their websites are performing. While some metrics may be more valuable to certain businesses than others, these are some of the most popular metrics:

1) Users. A user is a unique or new visitor to the website.
2) Bounce rate. The percentage of visitors who viewed only a single page. These visitors only triggered a single request to the Google Analytics server.
3) Sessions. The group of visitor interactions that happen in a 30-minute window of activity.
4) Average session duration. How long on average each visitor stays on the site.
5) Percentage of new sessions. The percentage of website visits that are first-time visits.
6) Pages per session. The average number of page views per each session.
7) Goal completions. The number of times visitors complete a specified, desirable action. This is also known as a conversion.
8) Page views. Total number of pages viewed.

## Objectives and Key Performance Indicators(KPI's):
1) To know about the audience interaction, I have shown Users and Sessions.
2) To know about the website traffic sources, I have shown different channels like Direct, Paid Search.
3) To understand the behavior of the visitors, the Landing Pages and Avg. Session Duration are shown.
4) To keep a track of conversions and business growth which are most important, E-commerce Conversion Rate, Transactions, Revenue are shown.


# For quarter Apr-Jun 2023, some important insights which I found: 

## Some of the important insights that I had gained from the Google Analytics Dashboard:

1) Users and Sessions increased by 27% and 21.9% with respect to last quarter respectively.
2) E-commerce Conversion Rate and Revenue decreased by 45.4% and 36.9% with respect to last quarter respectively.
3) Most of the traffic is coming from Direct and Paid Search, former having highest acquisition in terms of sessions of 1.78 lakhs but later having highest increase in sessions by 161.9%.
4) Highest Revenue is generated by 25-34 Age group, contributing close to 30% of the total.

## What is Cohort Analysis ?

Cohort Analysis is a type of Behavioral Analytics in which large volumes of complex Data is broken into related groups to perform Analysis. These smaller groups or Cohorts tend to share common characteristics or experiences within a specific time span. This process enables an organization to recognize important trends and patterns across the life cycle of a user/customer through a Cohort rather than accessing each individual customer.

Cohort Analysis is also used as a tool to measure user engagement over a period of time. Data from a given eCommerce platform, web application, or online game is used for Analysis and rather than looking at all users as a unit, it breaks them down into related groups.

Like customers who log on to the platform on a daily basis can be put into one Cohort, users which use the platform only once a month can be put into another Cohort, users subscribing for ad-free service can be put into one Cohort. These different Cohorts can help the organization target the requirements of these users better and strategize their services and products accordingly. The analysts of the social media platform would be catered with a visualization of these different groups, helping them to track the behavior of these users in a targeted manner.



## Some of the important insights that I had gained from the Cohort Analytics Dashboard:

1) On 28th April, there is highest Conversion Rate per User for returning visitors of 7.11%.
2) On 2nd May, the number of transactions are highest for new visitors of 61.
3) Conversion Rate per User is largest for Senegal, contributing to 34.8% of the total and Bounce Rate is greater than 70% for countries like Jordan, St. Pierre Miqulan and Belarus.

## What is Funnel Analytics ?

A funnel analysis is a method of understanding the steps required to reach an outcome on a website and how many users get through each of those steps. The set of steps is referred to as a “funnel” because the typical shape visualizing the flow of users is similar to a funnel in your kitchen or garage.

For example, consider a fictional e-commerce company whose ultimate goal (often called a conversion or macro conversion) is to get users who visit the site to make a purchase. The steps required to make a purchase on our site are: visiting the site, adding a product to the shopping cart, clicking to check out and completing the purchase. These steps are sometimes also called goals or micro conversions.


## Some of the important insights that I had gained from the Funnel Analytics Dashboard:

Out of the total engaged users, 52% entered the checkout process, 23% completed the purchase and only 2% made the registrations successfully.

## Some Recommendations based on the insights: 

1) Age group 25-34 gives highest revenue and this group is more tech savvy, so we can provide information about the latest tech products on the home page to increase conversions and revenue.
2) Bounce rate is higher for some countries, so we can reduce the bounce rate by making clear and attractive headlines on the pages, improving the page loading speed which are having high bounce rates.
3) More than half of the customers left during the checkout from 52% to 23%. Increasing checkout rate by providing a progress bar, using single page checkout, gifting or coupon options and mentioning delivery date.
